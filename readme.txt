I wrote the program in Atom on Mac and compiled it in terminal using gcc. The process for building the program in windows is as follows:

1. Save the TicTacToe.c file wherever you wish to save it.
2. Open Visual Studios. When it is open, minimise the window and open Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017 from the Start Menu.
3. Use the cd command to navigate to the folder location where you saved the file.
4. Use the command “cl TicTacToe.c” to compile the code.
5. Run the code by using the command “exe TicTacToe.c”
